/* 4. Create an abstract Division class with fields for a companyâ€™s division name and
      account number, and an abstract display() method. Use a constructor in the
      superclass that requires values for both fields. Create two subclasses named
      InternationalDivision and DomesticDivision. The InternationalDivision includes
      a field for the country in which the division is located and a field for the language spoken;
      its constructor requires both. The DomesticDivision includes a field for the state in
      which the division is located; a value for this field is required by the constructor.
      Write an application named UseDivision that creates InternationalDivision and
      DomesticDivision objects for two different companies and displays information
      about them. Save the files as Division.java, InternationalDivision.java,
      DomesticDivision.java, and UseDivision.java.*/
